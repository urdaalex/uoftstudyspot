# UofT Study Spot

Study Spot is a tool for UofT students to find rooms that are not scheduled for lectures, tutorials, or special events.

The site gets its information from ACE (Academic and Campus Events). Note that this does not guarantee the room is actually free, just that it's not officially booked.
