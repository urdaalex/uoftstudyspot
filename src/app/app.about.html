<h1>What is Study Spot...</h1>
<p>Study Spot is a tool for UofT students to find rooms that are not scheduled for lectures, tutorials, or special events.</p>
<p>
  The site gets its information from <a href="https://ace.utoronto.ca/">ACE</a> (Academic and Campus Events, UTSG) and <a href="http://registrar.utm.utoronto.ca/booking">ORBS</a> (Online Room Booking System, UTM). Note that this does not guarantee the room is
  actually free, just that it's not officially booked.
