<h1>What is Study Spot...</h1>
<p>Study Spot is a tool for UofT students to find rooms that are not scheduled for lectures, tutorials, or special events.</p>
<p>The site gets its information from <a href="http://www.osm.utoronto.ca/bookings/f?p=200:3:1449154985001201::NO:::">ACE (Academic and Campus Events).</a> Note that this does not guarantee the room is
  actually free, just that it's not officially booked.</p>
<p style="text-align:right; font-size:10px;">enjoy :)</p>
